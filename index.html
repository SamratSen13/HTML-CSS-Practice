    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge" target="_blank"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1599833975787-5c143f373c30?q=80&w=1856&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D" alt="Stonehenge" width="640" height="400"></a>
   <p>You can’t visit England without taking a trip to Stonehenge. The stone circle is one of the oldest monuments in Europe, dating back to the late Neolithic Age, around 3000BC. Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, you can walk in the footsteps of your Neolithic ancestors and explore the ancient landscape, world-class exhibition and visitors centre. You can give it a go on our London Explorer trip – we’ll take you there for the day to learn about the history of Stonehenge, followed by a trip to beautiful Bath, also on this list!</p>
   <h3>Know before you go</h3>
   <ol>
        <li>Stonehenge's location on an open plain leaves it at the mercy of the fickle British weather—something its neolithic architects didn't consider. Bring warm clothing and a waterproof jacket just in case.</li>
        <li>Most tours start at the Stonehenge Visitor Centre, more than a mile (1.6 km) from the stones. Skip the walk and take the free shuttle service, which speeds you there in less than 10 minutes. You can also hop off halfway and walk the rest so that the megaliths slowly come into view.</li>
        <li>Stonehenge is not well-served by public transport, so tours and day trips are the way to go. Most depart from Victoria coach station or central London hotels, and the journey straight there takes about two hours.</li>
   </ol>
   <h2><a href="/pages/cambridge.html">Cambridge</a></h2>
   <h3>What is the cheapest way to get from London to Cambridge?</h3>
   <ul>
        <li>The cheapest way to get from London to Cambridge is to rideshare which costs ₹420 - ₹850 and takes 1h 35m.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Primarily known as a city full of British intellect and architecture, Cambridge is home to some of the oldest colleges in England, including the grand 16th century Gothic King’s College Chapel, and the elegant Tudor Trinity College. The ancient colleges are situated along The River Cam, which runs through the heart of Cambridge and is one of the cities absolutely must do, quintessentially British experiences – punting. Rowing down the river whilst sipping a Pimms or two is a great way to see the city. And in the evening? Grab your bikes and head to one of the many traditional pubs dotted along the cobbled streets</p>
   <h2>The Cotswolds, Painswick</h2> 
   <dl>
    <dt>Is Painswick worth a visit?</dt>
    <dd>The sweet Cotswolds town of Painswick is a must-visit</dd>
   </dl>
   <p>If you’re after gently rolling hills and dozens of super cute quintessentially English towns, look no further than The Cotswolds, and in particular Painswick. The picture-perfect town is one of the best-preserved spots in the area, claiming the title ‘The Queen of The Cotswolds’ which makes it a worthy contender as another of the best places to visit in England.  With views over the Severn Valley to the Welsh mountains beyond, plenty of pubs and an abundance of charming winding streets, this is an ideal place to get some down time whilst soaking up the very best England has to offer. Make sure you head to Painswick Rococo Garden, an absolute masterpiece of 18th-century design.</p>
   <h2>Rye, East Sussex</h2>
   <p>This English town near the coast of East Sussex will really take you back in English time. Tudor buildings, medieval houses, antique stores, quirky shops, cobblestone streets and even a pretty harbour result in the perfect destination to really appreciate the charm and beauty of England. It’s also got the seaside town of Brighton right on the outskirts which you can visit to enjoy a day by the sea, chips on the pier, cool street art and a vibey creative scene.</p>
   <h2>Cornwall, Polperro</h2>
   <p>Seaside retreats done right, Cornwall is situated on the rugged Southwest tip of England and boasts some of the most beautiful beaches around – and why it’s continually voted as one of the best places to visit in England particularly in the height of summer. Polperro is one of the area’s prettiest unspoilt fishing villages with cottages clinging to the cliffs and narrow streets full of paintings, pottery, flowers and bakeries. Expect to find art galleries, exhibitions, shops and restaurants, and even air performances in this gem on the Cornish coast.</p>
   <h2>Bath</h2>
   <p>Situated on the Southwest hills, Bath is brimming with 18th century Georgian architecture and is undoubtedly one of England’s most stylish and beautiful towns. And the best bit? It really is known for its baths. Home to 2,000 year old Roman Baths and natural thermal spas, this is the ultimate relaxing weekend, and even offers a whole load of boutique shops, bars and restaurants to keep you entertained. Check out the beautiful botanic garden at Royal Victoria Park for a haven of calm whilst you’re there.</p>
   <h2 id="stratforduponavon">Stratford-Upon–Avon</h2>
   <p>The medieval market town with more than 800 years of history is famously also the home of England’s most iconic playwright, William Shakespeare. Born in Stratford in 1564, you can immediately see the ‘Romeo & Juliet’ inspirations when visiting Shakespeare’s hometown. With The Royal Shakespeare Company theatre performances, Warwick Castle and the charming Tudor town, nowhere says quintessential Britain quite like this.</p>
   <h2>Oxford</h2>
   <p>Best known for Oxford University, the oldest and most famous university in the English-speaking world, Oxford has educated 26 British prime ministers and 50 Nobel Prize winners. The prestigious city dates back to the 13th century and may be recognisable from the many Harry Potter scenes filmed here (reason enough to make it one of THE best places to visit in England!) . If you’re not buried away in books or Potter land, punt or cycle around the city and be sure to stop at one of the many afternoon tea spots. There’s no shortage of activities to enjoy.</p>
   <h2>The Lake District</h2>
   <p>If you’re after rugged British countryside look no further. As the UK’s most popular national park, the Lake District is one of the best places to visit in England, with its glistening lakes, never ending green hills and stunning natural beauty. The highest mountains in England are sure to give you some jaw-dropping panoramic views, tranquility and outdoor adventures. You can experience a taste of this on our England & Scotland trip.</p>
   <h2>The Peak District</h2>
   <p>Both the Lakes and the Peak are loved for the huge expanse of rugged wilderness they offer, whether it’s a day trip or week-long holiday you’ve got in mind – but each one is unique. The Lakes, as you’ve probably guessed, is more about the vast waters that surround those lush mountains, plus it’s roughly 1000 sq km bigger than the Peak, and contains more challenging walks. The Peak District is famed for its valley views, climbing crags and deep caves which you can explore. It’s also got some of Derbyshire’s best local pubs on its doorstep – you’ll need a hearty meal after stomping around the moors all day!

    Visit Chatsworth House whilst you’re here too, a huge stately home in the Derbyshire Dales with beautiful gardens, a local farm shop and wild animals roaming the grounds.</p>
